## Official Factor Lab source

- Root: `/tmp/quantmind_factor_lab_real_bounded_v7_orchestrator_v1/`
- Source: `/tmp/quantmind_factor_lab_real_bounded_v7_orchestrator_v1/backend/services/engine/factor_lab/`
- Branch: `factor-lab/real-bounded-v7-orchestrator-v1`
- Commit: `c83192c2278767e03f008bc39197b1ba33bfb6a9`
- It remained read-only and clean during QM2-P0-001G.

## Current position

- Architecture: QuantMind 2.0 Architecture v1, frozen.
- ADR-0009 and Research Decision Contract v1 are accepted architecture facts.
- They do not represent implemented Skill, Decision Validator, permission
  guard, state machine, budget controller, or Code Orchestrator runtime.
- Official V7 Factor Lab remains Python-first and does not yet satisfy the
  formal Decision-Control-Execution separation.
- Current task: `QM2-P0-001G`, completed as one architecture-only commit.
- Latest run: `QM2-P0-001G-20260714T142514Z-05c2db2`.
- Recommended next task: `QM2-P0-002A1 — Ledger Persistence Mechanism Audit
  and Domain Contract`; it has not started.

## Unconfirmed facts

- Concrete TongDaXin Provider implementation and capability contract.
- Long-term durable location for the official Factor Lab source.
- Unified database migration mechanism for QuantMind 2.0.
- Final artifact storage backend for large snapshot and ledger artifacts.
- A first-class Manifest field for non-correction relationships between runs.
- Concrete actor identity and permission policy for ResearchDecision.
- Persistent idempotency-key and semantic-duplicate policy.

## Constraints that must not be broken

- Do not replace LightGBM or Qlib.
- Do not put Python `factor_impl.py` in the v1 standard factor path.
- Keep Factor, Model, and Portfolio optimization separate.
- Keep Research Memory, Project Architecture Memory, and Implementation Ledger separate.
- Do not expose Frozen Test to Agent, Optimizer, or Campaign Memory.
- Do not treat plans, mocks, fixtures, fallbacks, or temporary evidence as implemented production facts.
- Do not modify accepted ADRs silently.
- Decision Layer may propose actions but cannot claim execution success.
- Code Orchestrator is the only controlled boundary to execution services.
- Execution services cannot autonomously choose the next research action.

## Next-session read order

Read `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, Project Charter, Architecture v1, Current State, this
Handoff, task-related ADRs, Component Catalog, the latest relevant
Implementation Run, then current code, Git state, and tests. For research-loop
tasks, also read ADR-0009 and `RESEARCH_DECISION_CONTRACT_V1.md`.
